Did you come to this talk wanting to learn about Documentation?

Well... it's not written yet, just like most documentation.

That disapointed feeling you feel right now because you came here for information and didn't find it... that's how users and other developers here when they look for documentation for most OSS projects.

To end, I'll use the phrase I hear more times than not; "It's a work in progress, It'll get it done eventually."


Note:
In all seriousness, I have written about half of this talk, but events at work the week before SELF and running around helping set up SELF burned all my time. Do you remember Jeremy talking during his keynote about how a staff member had an auto accident and we had to dispatch others to pick up gear.  That trip back to South Carolina and back burned the rest of the time I had to work on my talk.  I thought about trying to wing the rest of it, but I really feel that this talk need more prep.  Instead of canceling with no explaination, I decided to use the opertunity to try and make a lighthearted point.  I will finish this talk as soon as I'm available, and it'll be available online here, and I will probably be giving it live at other events.
