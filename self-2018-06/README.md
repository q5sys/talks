Did you come to this talk wanting to learn about Documentation?

Well... it's not written yet, just like most documentation.

That dissapointed feeling you feel right now because you came here for information and didn't find it... that's how users and other developers here when they look for documentation for most OSS projects. 

To end, I'll use the phrase I hear more times than not; "It's a work in progress, It'll get it done eventually."
