# The Anatomy of a Telegram Crypto Scam

I have heard about these before but I've never personally come across one to see it in action.  However on one random day in March of 2025, I was given the chance to look inside one and see how they operate.
This talk and repository will include complete logs of the entire process with the various people and channels they use and how they intend for this scam to work.  

After the talk is given a video of the presentation will be uploaded to the [Southeast Linuxfest Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/southeastlinuxfest).

Due to the nature of how these work, the question is always a matter of 'when' not 'if'. 

Financial Disclosure: Exploring the extent of this scam cost me $34. (Well worth it in my opinion)
